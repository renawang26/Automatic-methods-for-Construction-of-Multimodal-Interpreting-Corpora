    The Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) (Sharp et al. 1997) (Santiago et al. 2017) is widely used in many aspects and has accepted by publication. In this studying, we want to identify could we use the ASR confidence score to predict the human post edit. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems output a confidence score for each recognized word. The ASR confidence score is an estimate of how likely the word is to be correct (Wessel et al. 2001), the ASR confidence score is from 0 to 1.

    This R script used to evaluate the post edit ratio and ASR confidence level with the logistic regression model.
