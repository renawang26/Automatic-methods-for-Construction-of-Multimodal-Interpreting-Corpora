Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), as discussed in studies by Sharp et al. (1997) and Santiago et al. (2017), is a technology that has gained widespread usage and recognition in various fields, with its findings being accepted for publication. This study aims to explore the possibility of using the ASR confidence score as a predictor for human post-editing efforts. ASR systems assign a confidence score to each word they recognize, which reflects the probability of the word being correctly identified, as detailed by Wessel et al. (2001). These confidence scores range from 0 to 1.

In this context, we have developed an R script designed to assess the relationship between the post-edit ratio and the ASR confidence level. This evaluation is conducted using a logistic regression model.
